                        understand how and how to use machine learning and
                        <strong>deep learning </strong>.

                        Applying machine learning to the basics of coding using the Python
                        <strong>programming language</strong>, basic theory of machine learning and deep learning, image
                        recognition and natural language processing, etc. It covers a wide range of topics, from method to
                        method.



                        This tutorial is enriched with materials so that those who are interested in machine learning and
                        deep learning can start with the minimum required math and programming knowledge.

                        Therefore, it is created with the aim of being able to get into machine learning and deep learning
                        only with this site without looking for textbooks and materials other than this site as much as
                        possible. This site is aimed at beginners so that they can start learning without hesitation, "Why
                        should I start learning?"

                        Another feature of this tutorial is that the code that appears in the material can be executed on
                        the browser as it is by using the service called <strong>Google Colaboratory</strong> .

                        If you can write the code only in the browser, execute it, and check the result, you do not need to
                        build the environment on your computer to execute the sample code used for explanation and check the
                        result.

                        In this chapter, first, we will explain how to use this service called
                        <strong>Google Colaboratory </strong>.
